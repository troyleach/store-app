  {price: "5400.0", title: "David Oscarson Rosetta Stone Fountain Pen Translucent Grey", image: "http://www.executiveessentials.com/prod_images/DO%20PF%20RSG_S_01.jpg", description: "The Rosetta Stone was created in 196 BC as a tribute to Ptolemy V who began to rule Egypt at the age of five. The stone was erected on March 25th during the ninth year of his reign and contained a decree issued by a congress of priests who gathered at Memphis. The inscriptions proclaim Ptolemy V as the divine ruler of Egypt, Ever-Living and Beloved of Ptah, the Egyptian creator-god, maker of all things. In exchange for his divine status, Ptolemy V granted tax exemptions to the priesthood in Memphis whose political support was vital to ruling the kingdom. On July 15, 1799, the Rosetta Stone was re-discovered by French soldier Pierre-Francois Bouchard in the city of Rosetta (Modern day Rashid). The Rosetta Stone remained in control of French troops until March of 1801 when British troops took possession and transported it to England where it was presented to King George III. The stone now rests in the British Museum of Art and remains to this day the museum’s single most visited object.", category: "Pen", brand: "Rosetta Stone"},
